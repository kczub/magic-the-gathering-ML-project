### The purpose of this project is to explore machine learnig
The data comes from https://scryfall.com/docs/api/bulk-data.
I use Default Cards JSON file, which contains a lot of data, so I trim it according to my needs.

I made two datasets, one for predicting card types and another for predicting card prices. For now, I'm working more on data preprocessing than training models. I'm learning something new every day and try to apply these techniques to my own dataset.
